# Stock App
The application allows you to preview the stock. Currently it is in the visual phase, logical it does not work properly or at all, no global store for now.
I used framer-motion for the animation. The application itself is written in react.

Login and user database of the application will probably not be implemented, so creating a new user, actually does not create one.
You can login to the application: user: admin, password: password.
