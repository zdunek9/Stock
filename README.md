# Stock App
The application allows you to preview the stock. Currently it is in the visual phase, logical it does not work properly or at all, no global store for now.
I used framer-motion for the animation. The application is written in react.

Log in and user database of the application will probably not be implemented, so creating a new user, actually does not create one.
You can login to the application: user: admin, password: password.

## Features

+ Fleeing sign up confirm button
+ Basic account veryfication
+ RWD support
+ Status icon depends on item quantity 
+ Sort by quantity, status, user, date, comment and history name
