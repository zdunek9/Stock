# Stock App
The application allows you to preview the stock. No global store created, no redux, just a lot of API calls, all items from the API ( except history, its hard-coded )
I used framer-motion for the animation. The application created in react.

Application have basic user authentication and creating a new user, actually does not create one.
You can login as: "user: admin, password: password."
